# The-Last-Chapter-Bookstore
A Full Stack E-Commerce Book Store Project

The Aim of my project is to build a bookstore website that
allows the customer/seller to browse books, view details, search
books, write reviews, register account, purchase books, sell books
and also pay for the books completely online.

**About The Project:** The main purpose of my project is to allow
customers and sellers to buy and sell books online on my website,
**The Last Chapter.** I use various technologies and frameworks to build
a presentable and attractive User Interface for the front-end and also
have a robust and scalable back-end. I also make use of a RDBMS to
store and query userâ€™s data. I also use Pay Pal Integration for
payments, in order to gain real world use of API.
